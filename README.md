## Project Overview
**What is blackjack?**  
Blackjack is a gambling game involving playing cards. 
In short, the goal is to achieve a hand where the score is as close to 21 without exceeding it.
More info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack" target="_blank">here</a>. The rules of blackjack in this application will follow Wikipedia's definition. 

**What will this application do?**   
This application will allow a user to play blackjack against an automated dealer. 
The deck will contain the standard 52 cards and will act as a real deck of cards, meaning each card
can only appear once before the deck is reshuffled (so you can still count cards if you want ;).  
The user will start with a set amount of money and will place bets every round. If they run out of money, the game must be restarted. 
During their turn, the user will be given various decisions: hit, stand, double down and split (the last two are available if applicable).
If the dealer shows an ace, the user can also place an insurance bet. The dealer will stand on 17.  
The application will also allow the user to save their progress or start a new game.

**Who will use it?**
